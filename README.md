We are collecting our set of requirements and expectations for
acceptable application hosting.

Archtypes
---------

We are working with four initial archetypes:

1.  (Infrastructure-oriented) sysadmins
2.  Infrastructure-oriented developers
3.  Application-oriented developers
4.  Service-oriented partners

NB "infrastructure-oriented" and "application-oriented" are a horizontal
spectrum, *not* a value judgment. When a developer deploys a new
application release, it can be said that they are application-oriented.
That same developer might then tweak the number of running application
replicas, becoming an infrastructure-orinted developer.

We sometimes refer to "caring about infrastructure," but it's less about
whether someone actually cares than it is about whether someone *is
expected* to care about infrastructure when performing certain actions.

Someone has to care, but not everyone, and not all the time.
